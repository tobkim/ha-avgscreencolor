# ha-avgscreencolor
Powershell script (e.g. for HASS.Agent) to calculate the primary screen color of a PC's main screen. I have it running every 5 seconds, no impact on performance even when gaming.
For use with Home Assistant and RGB Lightbulbs ("Budget PC Ambilight"). 
Node-RED Example Flow included.
